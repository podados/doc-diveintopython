|    Thanks, Doug.                                                            |
|  * Fixed external link in Section 5.3, ??Defining Classes??. Thanks,        |
|    Harry.                                                                   |
|  * Changed wording at the end of Section 4.5, ??Filtering Lists??. Thanks,  |
|    Paul.                                                                    |
|  * Added sentence in Section 13.5, ??Testing for failure?? to make it       |
|    clearer that we're passing a function to assertRaises, not a function    |
|    name as a string. Thanks, Stephen.                                       |
|  * Fixed typo in Section 8.8, ??Introducing dialect.py??. Thanks, Wellie.   |
|  * Fixed links to dialectized examples.                                     |
|  * Fixed external link to the history of Roman numerals. Thanks to many     |
|    concerned Roman numeral fans around the world.                           |
|                                                                             |

+--------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+
|  * Added Section 10.3, ??Caching node lookups??.                            |
|  * Added Section 10.4, ??Finding direct children of a node??.               |
|  * Added Section 10.5, ??Creating separate handlers by node type??.         |
|  * Added Section 10.6, ??Handling command-line arguments??.                 |
|  * Added Section 10.7, ??Putting it all together??.                         |
|  * Added Section 10.8, ??Summary??.                                         |
|  * Fixed typo in Section 6.5, ??Working with Directories??. It's os.getcwd  |
|    (), not os.path.getcwd(). Thanks, Abhishek.                              |
|  * Fixed typo in Section 3.7, ??Joining Lists and Splitting Strings??.      |
|    When evaluated (instead of printed), the Python IDE will display single  |
|    quotes around the output.                                                |
|  * Changed str example in Section 4.8, ??Putting It All Together?? to use   |
|    a user-defined function, since Python 2.2 obsoleted the old example by   |
|    defining a doc string for the built-in dictionary methods. Thanks Eric.  |
|  * Fixed typo in Section 9.4, ??Unicode??, "anyway" to "anywhere". Thanks   |
|    Frank.                                                                   |
|  * Fixed typo in Section 13.6, ??Testing for sanity??, doubled word         |
|    "accept". Thanks Ralph.                                                  |
|  * Fixed typo in Section 15.3, ??Refactoring??, C?C?C? matches 0 to 3 C     |
|    characters, not 4. Thanks Ralph.                                         |
|  * Clarified and expanded explanation of implied slice indices in           |
|    Example 3.9, ??Slicing Shorthand??. Thanks Petr.                         |
|  * Added historical note in Section 5.5, ??Exploring UserDict: A Wrapper    |
|    Class?? now that Python 2.2 supports subclassing built-in datatypes      |
|    directly.                                                                |
|  * Added explanation of update dictionary method in Example 5.9, ??         |
|    Defining the UserDict Class??. Thanks Petr.                              |
|  * Clarified Python's lack of overloading in Section 5.5, ??Exploring       |
|    UserDict: A Wrapper Class??. Thanks Petr.                                |
|  * Fixed typo in Example 8.8, ??Introducing BaseHTMLProcessor??. HTML       |
|    comments end with two dashes and a bracket, not one. Thanks Petr.        |
|  * Changed tense of note about nested scopes in Section 8.5, ??locals and   |
|    globals?? now that Python 2.2 is out. Thanks Petr.                       |
|  * Fixed typo in Example 8.14, ??Dictionary-based string formatting in      |
|    BaseHTMLProcessor.py??; a space should have been a non-breaking space.   |
|    Thanks Petr.                                                             |
|  * Added title to note on derived classes in Section 5.5, ??Exploring       |
|    UserDict: A Wrapper Class??. Thanks Petr.                                |
|  * Added title to note on downloading unittest in Section 15.3, ??          |
|    Refactoring??. Thanks Petr.                                              |
|  * Fixed typesetting problem in Example 16.6, ??Running scripts in the      |
|    current directory??; tabs should have been spaces, and the line numbers  |
|    were misaligned. Thanks Petr.                                            |
|  * Fixed capitalization typo in the tip on truth values in Section 3.2, ??  |
|    Introducing Lists??. It's True and False, not true and false. Thanks to  |
|    everyone who pointed this out.                                           |
|  * Changed section titles of Section 3.1, ??Introducing Dictionaries??,     |
|    Section 3.2, ??Introducing Lists??, and Section 3.3, ??Introducing Tuples|
|    ??. "Dictionaries 101" was a cute way of saying that this section was an |
|    beginner's introduction to dictionaries. American colleges tend to use   |
|    this numbering scheme to indicate introductory courses with no           |
|    prerequisites, but apparently this is a distinctly American tradition,   |
|    and it was unnecessarily confusing my international readers. In my       |
|    defense, when I initially wrote these sections a year and a half ago, it |
|    never occurred to me that I would have international readers.            |
|  * Upgraded to version 1.52 of the DocBook XSL stylesheets.                 |
|  * Upgraded to version 6.52 of the SAXON XSLT processor from Michael Kay.   |
|  * Various accessibility-related stylesheet tweaks.                         |
|  * Somewhere between this revision and the last one, she said yes. The      |
|    wedding will be next spring.                                             |
|                                                                             |

|  * Fixed typo in Example 4.15, ??Introducing and??.                         |
|  * Fixed typo in Example 2.4, ??Import Search Path??.                       |
|  * Fixed Windows help file (missing table of contents due to base           |
|    stylesheet changes).                                                     |

+--------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+
|  * Expanded Section 2.4, ??Everything Is an Object?? to include more about  |
|    import search paths.                                                     |
|  * Fixed typo in Example 3.7, ??Negative List Indices??. Thanks to Brian    |
|    for the correction.                                                      |
|  * Rewrote the tip on truth values in Section 3.2, ??Introducing Lists??,   |
|    now that Python has a separate boolean datatype.                         |
|  * Fixed typo in Section 5.2, ??Importing Modules Using from module import  |
|    ?? when comparing syntax to Java. Thanks to Rick for the correction.     |
|  * Added note in Section 5.5, ??Exploring UserDict: A Wrapper Class??       |
|    about derived classes always overriding ancestor classes.                |
|  * Fixed typo in Example 5.18, ??Modifying Class Attributes??. Thanks to    |
|    Kevin for the correction.                                                |
|  * Added note in Section 6.1, ??Handling Exceptions?? that you can define   |
|    and raise your own exceptions. Thanks to Rony for the suggestion.        |
|  * Fixed typo in Example 8.17, ??Handling specific tags??. Thanks for Rick  |
|    for the correction.                                                      |
|  * Added note in Example 8.18, ??SGMLParser?? about what the return codes   |
|    mean. Thanks to Howard for the suggestion.                               |
|  * Added str function when creating StringIO instance in Example 10.6, ??   |
|    openAnything??. Thanks to Ganesan for the idea.                          |
|  * Added link in Section 13.3, ??Introducing romantest.py?? to explanation  |
|    of why test cases belong in a separate file.                             |
|  * Changed Section 16.2, ??Finding the path?? to use os.path.dirname        |
|    instead of os.path.split. Thanks to Marc for the idea.                   |
|  * Added code samples (piglatin.py, parsephone.py, and plural.py) for the   |
|    upcoming regular expressions chapter.                                    |
|  * Updated and expanded list of Python distributions on home page.          |
|                                                                             |

+--------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+
|  * Added Section 9.4, ??Unicode??.                                          |
|  * Added Section 9.5, ??Searching for elements??.                           |

|    Section 6.3, ??Iterating with for Loops??. Thanks to Kevin for the idea. |
|  * Fixed typo in Example 3.25, ??The keys, values, and items Functions??    |
|    (two elements of params.values() were reversed).                         |
|  * Fixed mistake in Section 4.3, ??Using type, str, dir, and Other          |
|    Built-In Functions?? with regards to the name of the __builtin__ module. |
|    Thanks to Denis for the correction.                                      |
|  * Added additional example in Section 16.2, ??Finding the path?? to show   |
|    how to run unit tests in the current working directory, instead of the   |
|    directory where regression.py is located.                                |
|  * Modified explanation of how to derive a negative list index from a       |
|    positive list index in Example 3.7, ??Negative List Indices??. Thanks to |

|  * Updated links on home page for downloading latest version of Python.     |
|  * Added link on home page to Bruce Eckel's preliminary draft of Thinking   |
|    in Python (http://www.mindview.net/Books/TIPython), a marvelous (and     |
|    advanced) book on design patterns and how to implement them in Python.   |
|                                                                             |

+--------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+
|  * Added Section 16.2, ??Finding the path??.                                |
|  * Added Section 16.3, ??Filtering lists revisited??.                       |

|  * Expanded sample output in Section 16.1, ??Diving in??.                   |
|  * Finished Section 9.3, ??Parsing XML??.                                   |
|                                                                             |

+--------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+
|  * Added Section 9.2, ??Packages??.                                         |
|  * Added Section 9.3, ??Parsing XML??.                                      |
|  * Cleaned up introductory paragraph in Section 9.1, ??Diving in??. Thanks  |
|    to Matt for this suggestion.                                             |
|  * Added Java tip in Section 5.2, ??Importing Modules Using from module     |
|    import??. Thanks to Ori for this suggestion.                             |
|  * Fixed mistake in Section 4.8, ??Putting It All Together?? where I        |
|    implied that you could not use is None to compare to a null value in     |
|    Python. In fact, you can, and it's faster than == None. Thanks to Ori    |
|    pointing this out.                                                       |
|  * Clarified in Section 3.2, ??Introducing Lists?? where I said that li =   |
|    li + other was equivalent to li.extend(other). The result is the same,   |
|    but extend is faster because it doesn't create a new list. Thanks to     |
|    Denis pointing this out.                                                 |
|  * Fixed mistake in Section 3.2, ??Introducing Lists?? where I said that    |
|    li += other was equivalent to li = li + other. In fact, it's equivalent  |
|    to li.extend(other), since it doesn't create a new list. Thanks to Denis |
|    pointing this out.                                                       |
|  * Fixed typographical laziness in Chapter 2, Your First Python Program;    |
|    when I was writing it, I had not yet standardized on putting string      |
|    literals in single quotes within the text. They were set off by          |
|    typography, but this is lost in some renditions of the book (like plain  |
|    text), making it difficult to read. Thanks to Denis for this suggestion. |
|  * Fixed mistake in Section 2.2, ??Declaring Functions?? where I said that  |
|    statically typed languages always use explicit variable + datatype       |
|    declarations to enforce static typing. Most do, but there are some       |
|    statically typed languages where the compiler figures out what type the  |
|    variable is based on usage within the code. Thanks to Tony for pointing  |
|    this out.                                                                |

+--------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+
|  * Added code in BaseHTMLProcessor to handle non-HTML entity references,    |
|    and added a note about it in Section 8.4, ??Introducing                  |
|    BaseHTMLProcessor.py??.                                                  |
|  * Modified Example 8.11, ??Introducing globals?? to include                |
|    htmlentitydefs in the output.                                            |

|  * Finished Chapter 8, HTML Processing with Section 8.9, ??Putting it all   |
|    together?? and Section 8.10, ??Summary??.                                |
|  * Added Section 15.4, ??Postscript??.                                      |
|  * Started Chapter 9, XML Processing with Section 9.1, ??Diving in??.       |
|  * Started Chapter 16, Functional Programming with Section 16.1, ??Diving   |
|    in??.                                                                    |
|  * Fixed long-standing bug in colorizing script that improperly colorized   |
|    the examples in Chapter 8, HTML Processing.                              |
|  * Added link to French translation (http://fr.diveintopython.org/toc.html  |
|    ). They did the right thing and translated the source XML, so they can   |
|    re-use all my build scripts and make their work available in six         |
|    different formats.                                                       |
|  * Upgraded to version 1.43 of the DocBook XSL stylesheets.                 |
|  * Upgraded to version 6.43 of the SAXON XSLT processor from Michael Kay.   |
|  * Massive stylesheet changes, moving away from a table-based layout and    |
|    towards more appropriate use of cascading style sheets. Unfortunately,   |
|    CSS has as many compatibility problems as anything else, so there are    |
|    still some tables used in the header and footer. The resulting HTML      |
|    version looks worse in Netscape 4, but better in modern browsers,        |
|    including Netscape 6, Mozilla, Internet Explorer 5, Opera 5, Konqueror,  |
|    and iCab. And it's still completely readable in Lynx. I love Lynx. It was|
|    my first web browser. You never forget your first.                       |
|  * Moved to Ant (http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/) to have better control     |
|    over the build process, which is especially important now that I'm       |
|    juggling six output formats and two languages.                           |
|  * Consolidated the available downloadable archives; previously, I had      |
|    different files for each platform, because the .zip files that Python's  |
|    zipfile module creates are non-standard and can't be opened by Aladdin   |
|    Expander on Mac OS. But the .zip files that Ant creates are completely   |
|    standard and cross-platform. Go Ant!                                     |
|  * Now hosting the complete XML source, XSL stylesheets, and associated     |
|    scripts and libraries on SourceForge. There's also CVS access for the    |
|    really adventurous.                                                      |
|  * Re-licensed the example code under the new-and-improved GPL-compatible   |
|    Python 2.1.1 license (http://www.python.org/2.1.1/license.html). Thanks, |
|    Guido; people really do care, and it really does matter.                 |
|                                                                             |

|  * Added case-sensitivity example in Section 3.1, ??Introducing             |
|    Dictionaries??.                                                          |
|  * Use os.path.normcase in Chapter 5, Objects and Object-Orientation to     |
|    compensate for inferior operating systems whose files aren't             |
|    case-sensitive.                                                          |
|  * Fixed indentation problems in code samples in PDF version.               |
|                                                                             |

|  * Fixed bug in CSS (introduced in 2.9) where body background color was     |
|    missing.                                                                 |

+--------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+
|  * Added code in BaseHTMLProcessor.py to handle declarations, now that      |
|    Python 2.1 supports them.                                                |
|  * Added note about nested scopes in Section 8.5, ??locals and globals??.   |
|  * Fixed obscure bug in Example 8.1, ??BaseHTMLProcessor.py?? where         |
|    attribute values with character entities would not be properly escaped.  |
|  * Now recommending (but not requiring) Python 2.1, due to its support of   |
|    declarations in sgmllib.py.                                              |
|  * Updated download links on the home page (http://diveintopython.org/) to  |
|    point to Python 2.1, where available.                                    |
|  * Moved to versioned filenames, to help people who redistribute the book.  |
|                                                                             |

|  * Tightened code in Chapter 8, HTML Processing, specifically               |
|    ChefDialectizer, to use fewer and simpler regular expressions.           |
|  * Fixed a stylesheet bug that was inserting blank pages between chapters   |
|    in the PDF version.                                                      |
|  * Fixed a script bug that was stripping the DOCTYPE from the home page (   |
|    http://diveintopython.org/).                                             |
|  * Added link to Python Cookbook (http://www.activestate.com/ASPN/Python/   |
|    Cookbook/), and added a few links to individual recipes in Appendix A,   |
|    Further reading.                                                         |
|  * Switched to Google (http://www.google.com/services/free.html) for        |
|    searching on http://diveintopython.org/.                                 |
|  * Upgraded to version 1.36 of the DocBook XSL stylesheets, which was much  |
|    more difficult than it sounds. There may still be lingering bugs.        |
|                                                                             |

|  * Tightened up code in Chapter 4, The Power Of Introspection, using the    |
|    built-in function callable instead of manually checking types.           |
|  * Moved Section 5.2, ??Importing Modules Using from module import?? from   |
|    Chapter 4, The Power Of Introspection to Chapter 5, Objects and          |

|  * Changed code in Chapter 2, Your First Python Program to use items        |
|    method instead of keys.                                                  |
|  * Moved Section 3.4.2, ??Assigning Multiple Values at Once?? section to    |
|    Chapter 2, Your First Python Program.                                    |
|  * Edited note about join string method, and provided a link to the new     |
|    entry in The Whole Python FAQ (http://www.python.org/doc/FAQ.html) that  |
|    explains why join is a string method (http://www.python.org/cgi-bin/     |
|    faqw.py?query=4.96&querytype=simple&casefold=yes&req=search) instead of a|
|    list method.                                                             |
|  * Rewrote Section 4.6, ??The Peculiar Nature of and and or?? to emphasize  |
|    the fundamental nature of and and or and de-emphasize the and-or trick.  |
|  * Reorganized language comparisons into notes.                             |
|                                                                             |

+--------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+
|  * The PDF and Word versions now have colorized examples, an improved       |
|    table of contents, and properly indented tips and notes.                 |
|  * The Word version is now in native Word format, compatible with Word 97.  |
|  * The PDF and text versions now have fewer problems with improperly        |
|    converted special characters (like trademark symbols and curly quotes).  |
|  * Added link to download Word version for UNIX, in case some twisted soul  |
|    wants to import it into StarOffice or something.                         |
|  * Fixed several notes which were missing titles.                           |
|  * Fixed stylesheets to work around bug in Internet Explorer 5 for Mac OS   |
|    which caused colorized words in the examples to be displayed in the wrong|
|    font. (Hello?!? Microsoft? Which part of <pre> don't you understand?)    |
|  * Fixed archive corruption in Mac OS downloads.                            |
|  * In first section of each chapter, added link to download examples. (My   |
|    access logs show that people skim or skip the two pages where they could |
|    have downloaded them (the home page (http://diveintopython.org/) and     |
|    preface), then scramble to find a download link once they actually start |
|    reading.)                                                                |
|  * Tightened the home page (http://diveintopython.org/) and preface even    |
|    more, in the hopes that someday someone will read them.                  |
|  * Soon I hope to get back to actually writing this book instead of         |
|    debugging it.                                                            |

|  * Fixed program listing in Example 6.10, ??Iterating Through a Dictionary  |
|    ?? which was missing a colon.                                            |

+--------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+
|  * Changed newsgroup links to use "news:" protocol, now that deja.com is    |

+--------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+
|  * Rewrote some of the code in Chapter 5, Objects and Object-Orientation    |

|  * Fixed important error in Section 2.2, ??Declaring Functions??:           |
|    functions that do not explicitly return a value return None, so you can  |
|    assign the return value of such a function to a variable without raising |
|    an exception.                                                            |

+--------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+
|  * Rewrote the example code of Chapter 4, The Power Of Introspection to     |
|    use getattr instead of exec and eval, and rewrote explanatory text to    |
|    match.                                                                   |
