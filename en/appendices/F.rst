Appendix F. About the book
===========================

This book was written in DocBook XML (http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/) using
Emacs (http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), and converted to HTML using the
SAXON XSLT processor from Michael Kay (http://saxon.sourceforge.net/) with a
customized version of Norman Walsh's XSL stylesheets (http://www.nwalsh.com/xsl
/). From there, it was converted to PDF using HTMLDoc (http://www.easysw.com/
htmldoc/), and to plain text using w3m (http://ei5nazha.yz.yamagata-u.ac.jp/
~aito/w3m/eng/). Program listings and examples were colorized using an updated
version of Just van Rossum's pyfontify.py, which is included in the example
scripts.

If you're interested in learning more about DocBook for technical writing, you
can download the XML source (http://diveintopython.org/download/
diveintopython-xml-5.4.zip) and the build scripts (http://diveintopython.org/
download/diveintopython-common-5.4.zip), which include the customized XSL
stylesheets used to create all the different formats of the book. You should
also read the canonical book, DocBook: The Definitive Guide (http://
www.docbook.org/). If you're going to do any serious writing in DocBook, I
would recommend subscribing to the DocBook mailing lists (http://
lists.oasis-open.org/archives/).
