le loisir de la faire plus courte.
(I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.)

Diving In
---------

This book, like all books, was a labor of love. Oh sure, I got paid
the medium-sized bucks for it, but nobody writes technical books for
the money. And since this book is available on the web as well as on
paper, I spent a lot of time fiddling with webby stuff when I should
have been writing.

The online edition loads as efficiently as possible. Efficiency never
happens by accident; I spent many hours making it so. Perhaps too many
hours. Yes, almost certainly too many hours. Never underestimate the
depths to which a procrastinating writer will sink.
I wont bore you with all the details. Wait, yesI will bore you with
all the details. But heres the short version.

#. HTML is minimized, then served `compressed`_.
#. Scripts and stylesheets are minimized by `YUI Compressor`_ (and
also served compressed).
#. Scripts are combined to reduce HTTP requests.
#. Stylesheets are combined and inlined to reduce HTTP requests.
#. Unused CSS selectors and properties are `removed on a page-by-page
basis`_ with a little help from `pyquery`_.
#. HTTP caching and other server-side options are optimized based on
advice from `YSlow`_ and `Page Speed`_.
#. Pages use `Unicode characters`_ in place of images wherever
possible.
#. Images are optimized with `OptiPNG`_.
#. The entire book was `lovingly hand-authored in HTML 5`_ to avoid
   markup cruft.
